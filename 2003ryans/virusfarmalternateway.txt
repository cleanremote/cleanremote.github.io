This is if Virus Farm goes down at any time by faggots frying it.
So what you do is go to http://computernewb.com/collab-vm/ (DO NOT CLICK TINY7)
Then you think about which node you want to go to.
For node 1 or 2, go here: http://hastebin.com/raw/nijurujiva.coffee
For node 3, go here: http://hastebin.com/raw/zelowelila.coffee
Then, go back to the collabvm tab, then press Ctrl+Shift+I then press Console.
Then go back to the hastebin tab and copy paste ALL OF IT into the console then press enter.
If it doesn't work you either didn't copy it correctly or the node is down.
If it succeeds you should see the node(s) appear.
Click the node you want and have fun.
